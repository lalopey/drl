# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

![Trained Agents][image1]

This repository contains solutions to the projects in the  [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.  

## Projects

There's three projects in this repository use the following links or navigate to each directory to see the results of the finished projects:

- [1 - Navigation DQN](https://github.com/lalopey/drl/tree/master/1%20-%20Navigation%20-DQN)

## Install

### Step 1: Clone the DRLND Repository

----------

Please follow the  [instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies)  to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in  `README.md`  at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

(_For Windows users_) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. While it might be possible to run the ML-Agents toolkit using other versions of Windows, it has not been tested on other versions. Furthermore, the ML-Agents toolkit has not been tested on a Windows VM such as Bootcamp or Parallels.


### Step 2: Install drltools package

----------

Clone this repository, and navigate to the root directory. Then, install the drltools package.

- git clone https://github.com/lalopey/drl.git
- pip install .
